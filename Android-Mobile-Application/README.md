## Project Description:
An android mobile application named 'PlaceToLive'. 
The goal of our app is to help people find the perfect room or apartment according to their preferences. The application we developed would allow users to post advertisements of room availabilities by uploading pictures and providing necessary details like rent, facilities, etc. People who are looking for accommodation can view all the advertisement posted by different users. The main motivation behind working on this application was to help those people who are newcomers to a country or are yet to come to easily find accommodation according to their preferences. The application was developed especially for students and people who migrate to other countries for any purpose.
