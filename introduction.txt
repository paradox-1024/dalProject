Honour Thesis - Data Augmentation Approaches on 3D U-Net Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation

- The goal of this study is to evaluate the augmentation techniques for brain tumor segmentation, utilizing the Brats 2020 dataset as input and applying the standard 3D U-Net model. 

- Augmentation techniques such as contrast adjustment, flipping, rotation, brightness alteration, small pixel dropout, gaussian noise, and swirling have been applied to see their effect on the model's accuracy.
